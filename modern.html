    <h2>Drone Warfare</h2>
    <p>
      Pilotless vehicles were initially developed in the UK in the First World War and development continued         throughout the interwar period. They began to be used on a larger scale during the Vietnam War by the US as Reconnaissance UAVs (Unmanned Ariel Vehicles), but they were also used as combat decoys, for finding targets to launch missiles, and for dropping leaflets and posters for psychological propaganda [1]. Drones were used at an even greater scale in Afghanistan in the 2000s where they moved from taking a more surveillance focussed role, to an active combat role, as this was the era of the first known lethal drone strike [2]. Today, drones have been used in the Russia-Ukraine war, both as direct attacks on Ukrainian cities and as threatening surveillance in other countries in Europe including Germany and Norway, displaying how useful they are [3]. </p>

    <h3>The Aerodynamics of Drones</h3>
       
Drone flight (and any aircraft flight) involves four forces: 
<p>

Lift: The upward force that counteracts weight and allows the drone to remain in the air. Lift arises due to the pressure difference between the top and the bottom of the wing of the aircraft and the downward deflection of air, which produces an upward force equal and opposite to it. The left equation is given by
<br>
  $$
L = \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 C_L S
$$
  where $\rho$ is the air density, $v$ is the air speed, $C_L$ is the lift coefficient, and $S$ is the wing area [5].This links to warfare as military drones often require efficient lift to save energy to carry out long surveillances. As well as this, high altitude drones need larger wings due to lower air density to stay airborne. 

</p>
<p>
Weight: Downward force exerted by Earth's gravitational field. This means drones with more mass (mass is often increased by equipment such as weapons, cameras or sensors) need greater lift, which uses more energy and requires better propellers or more powerful motors. The weight equation is given by 
<br> 
  $$
  W = mg
  $$
  where $m$ is the mass of the drone and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity [6].
<br> 
Military drones are often also made using lightweight materials, for example: 
<br> 
 Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) - This is used for wings, airframes, propeller arms. It has a high strength to weight ratio and low density leading to an overall lower weight. It also has a high stiffness which reduces the amount of potential aerodynamic deformation while in flight. 
<br> 
 Fiberglass Composites – These are used for fuselages (the main body of drone, including electronics and flight systems) and radar covers. It is a lightweight material. It also allows EM radar waves to go straight through with little absorption or reflection so the drone is not easy to detect. 
<br> 
Titanium alloys – These are used to house the engine and other particularly important parts as it has very high strength and so is unlikely to deform. It is also heat resistant so it works well at protecting specific parts of the drone. 
</p>
 <p>

Thrust: The upward force produced by the propulsion system of the drone. The propellers push the air backwards and this change in momentum creates thrust in the forward direction. This force is given by 
<br> 
  $$
  F = \dot{m} (v_{exit} - v_{entry}) 
  $$
  where $\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate of the air, $v_{exit}$ is the velocity of the air as it leaves the propeller system, and $v_{entry}$ is the velocity of the air as it enters the propeller system [7].
Thrust in drones is produced by electric motors (which produce an electromagnetic torque) and batteries or internal combustion engines. However it is also good to consider the noise level of each type of motor as this is key for drone detection. This is important in a war setting because thrust determines how fast a drone can accelerate and therefore how fast it can escape an attack. 
 </p>
 <p>

Drag: The force opposing motion through a fluid (air, in the case of drones). This is given by 
<br> 
  $$
  D = \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 C_D S
  $$
  where $C_D$ is the drag coefficient [8]. The types of drag include parasitic drag (from the body, wings, weapons etc of the drone), induced drag (caused by generating lift), and skin friction (due to the viscosity of the air). The reduction of drag is important in drones because it increases two-fold with speed and external weaponry can significantly increase it. Drag can be decreased by using streamlined designs, increasing the efficiency and flight time. 
    </p>

    <h3>Control and Navigation</h3>
    <p>
      When a drone is flying it must know its speed, direction and orientation at all times, and so it uses sensors and feedback systems in order to control this. 

    </p>
<p>
One key movement that a drone must control is its rotation. Drones can rotate about the three axes: roll (tilting left and right); pitch (tilting forwards and backwards); and yaw (turning left and right horizontally). The equation for torque dictates a drone's orientation in the air, by showing how changing the motor forces (and so, changing the acceleration) alters the torque, the turning force that allows it to rotate. The equation for torque is given by
  $$ 
  \tau = I \alpha
  $$
  where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration of the drone [9].
    </p>
<p>
  Some drones also use MEMS gyroscopes (devices that maintain orientation and angular velocity, using the principle of momentum of angular velocity). As the drone rotates, internal vibrating parts of it experience a sideways force (the Coriolis effect) and this force is proportional to the angular velocity. The gyroscope outputs information about its current angular velocity and tilt. This information is processed by a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller which compares it with the desired angular velocity and tilt of the drone and calculates by how much the motor speed needs to be altered, so that the drone can restabilize. 
</p>
  <p> 
  Another important aspect of drone movement is acceleration. Drones are fitted with accelerometers which rely on Newton's 2nd Law:
    $$
    F = ma
    $$
    where $m$ is the mass of the drone and $a$ is its acceleration [10].
    <br>
    This equation is used to calculate linear acceleration in the x,y,z planes. The accelerometer contains a small mass which is suspended by springs. This mass lags behind when the drone accelerates and the accelerometer casing moves with it. This compresses or stretches a spring (depending on direction) and a restoring force develops in the spring. The displacement of the spring is measured. This information is also processed by a PID controller which tells it how to correct any undesired changes in speed or direction. Some drones use MEMS accelerometers instead, where there is no spring, rather the mass forms part of a capacitor. As it moves the distance between the plates of the capacitor changes, causing the capacitance to change according to 
    $$
    C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}
    $$
    where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric permittivity, $A$ is the area of the plates, and $d$ is the distance between the plates [11]. This generates an electrical signal which is then processed by the PID controller. 
  </p>
    <h3>Sensors and Target Detection</h3>
    <p>
      Modern drones make use of sensors to detect and attack enemy targets. These sensors measure certain physical phenomena and convert the information into electrical signals which allows it to be processed by a computer or an autonomous system. 
    </p>
  <p>
    Optical Cameras: These measure reflected visible electromagnetic waves (visible light - wavelength range: 400-700nm). Objects that are in the path of the drone reflect light due to their colour and texture. This light is detected by a lens on the drone which uses refraction to focus it, which is governed by Snell's Law:
    $$
    n_1 sin\theta_1 = n_2 sin\theta_2
    $$
    where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the initial and final media respectively, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction respectively [12].
 <br>
    This, now focussed, image is detected by a sensor which uses the photoelectric effect to emit electrons and the intensity of the electrons is governed by the intensity of the light. More electrons generate a stronger signal, which can be used to determine how close an object is. However, optical cameras do have limited use due to poor performance in darkness, smoke or dust. So they are not often sufficient alone for combat. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Infrared (thermal imaging) sensors: These measure infrared radiation emitted by objects (wavelength range: 8-14μm - long-wave IR). The background physics follows that of blackbody radiation - all objects that have temperature above 0K emit radiation according to the principle of blackbody radiation. The power radiated by an object is given by
    $$
    P = \sigma A T^4
    $$
    where $\sigma$ is the Steffan-Boltzmann constant, $A$ is the area, and $T$ is the temperature [13].
    <br>
    Hotter objects emit more radiation. The imaging cameras detect the radiation and focus it onto a sensor array, which converts the information into an electrical signal which can be interpreted as a colourful image, with different colours showing different temperatures. Therefore, thermal imaging sensors are very useful in warfare because they can detect anything that emits heat, including humans, vehicles that are running, and weapons that have recently been or are being fired. They can be detected even at night and in poor visibility. However, thermal imaging does have limitations, including lower heat contrasts in hotter settings, decreased effectiveness in heavy rain, or if objects are thermally shielded (temperature minimized through heat transfer by insulation or reflection). 
  </p>
  <p>
    Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging): This measures speed, distance and shape of objects using radiowave and microwave radiation (wavelength range: 1mm to 1m). Radar emits an electromagnetic pulse (short, intense burst). This pulse reflects off of an object and its echo returns to a detector. Distance is calculated by multiplying the time between the signal being sent out and its echo being detected with the speed of EM waves, and then dividing it by 2. If the target is moving, the Doppler Effect must be used. The observed frequency from the Doppler Effect is given by
    $$
    f_0 = f_s \frac{v \pm v_0}{v \mp v_s}
    $$
    where $f_s$ is the source frequency, $v$ is the sound wave velocity, $v_0$ is the observer velocity, and $v_s$ is the source velocity [14].
    <br>
    This is useful in a military setting because it works in all weather conditions and light conditions and is really good for measuring the distance of objects that are far away. Radar's limitations included high power usage and ineffectiveness against stealth technology - vehicles and weapons can be designed using certain shapes and angles that deflect the waves in the wrong direction, or they are coated with materials that absorb the waves rather than reflect them. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging): This is a very similar concept to Radar but uses laser pulses (infrared/visible light) rather than radiowave or microwave pulses. The background physics is also similar to that of Radar (pulses sent out, return time measured and distance calculated). However, Lidar is used more to make detailed, high resolution 3D maps, rather than work out the distance to objects. Military uses include terrain mapping, avoiding certain obstacles and urban reconnaissance. However, its limitations are that it is less effective in rain, fog, smoke and dust (due to these things blocking the light signals being blocked) and, because it is an active sensor (constantly sending out signals), it is more easily detected by the enemy than passive sensors. 
  </p>
  <h3>Communication Systems</h3>
  <p>
    Military drones use radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves to communicate with other drones, satellites and on-the-ground operators. This means they transmit information. The types of information include control commands (direction and speed), sensor data (video and radar), and status details (battery and potential damage). These commands use microwave EM radiation in the GHz frequency range. 
  </p>
  <p>
    RF communication uses electromagnetic wave propagation (at speed of light). It uses wave modulation to carry certain signals 
  </p>
  <p>
    Amplitude Modulation (AM): Frequency and phase remain constant - only amplitude (strength of wave) changes. Stronger signal = larger oscillation peaks and weaker signal = smaller oscillation peaks. The variations of strength are what conveys the message. However AM is rarely used in a military setting because it is affected significantly by noise. The electric field for this signal is given by
  $$
    E(t) = [A + m(t)]sin(2 \pi f t)
    $$
    where $t$ is the time, $A$ is the amplitude, $m$ is the information signal, and $f$ is the frequency [15].
  </p>
  <p>
    Frequency Modulation (FM): Only frequency is varied (around a central value) - this changes the phase indirectly, but all else is kept constant. Information is encoded as small shifts in the frequency. FM is far more reliable in a military setting than AM as it is not affected much by noise. It is mostly used for radio control and voice messages. The frequency shift is what encodes the information. The electric field for FM is given by
$$
    E(t) = Asin(2 \pi [f + \Delta f(t)]t)
    $$
    where $\Delta f(t)$ is the frequenct shift [16].
  </p>
   <p>
     Phase Modulation (PM): Amplitude and frequency stay constant, while phase is shifted either forwards or backwards. The instantaneous amplitude of the base signal modifies the phase of the carrier signal keeping amplitude and frequency constant. This delivers the message in phase shifts. PM is good because it is resistant  to noise and is very efficient. It is mostly used for digital messages and encrypted links. The phase shift is what encodes the information. The electric field for this is given by
     $$
     E(t) = Asin(2 \pi ft + \phi (t))
     $$
     where $\phi (t)$ is the phase shift [17].
   </p>
  <p>
    There are numerous downsides to RF communication, however.  These include
  </p>
  <p>
    Line of sight Limitations: Radio waves travel in straight lines and therefore do not bend around the curvature of the Earth's surface, nor obstacles. The horizon limitation is approximately calculated using the equation below. This means that low-flying drones are affected, as are ones used in urban settings, as they lose connection easily. The approximation for the horizon limit is given by
    $$
    d ~ \sqrt{2Rh}
    $$
    where $R$ is the radius of the Earth and $h$ is the height of the drone [16].
  </p>
  <p>
    Loss of signal strength: Radio waves spread out according to the inverse square law as they travel. This means that increasing distance greatly decreases power, making long-range drone control difficult. This power loss is described by
    $$
    P \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
    $$
    where $r$ is the distance from the signal transmitter [17].
  </p>
  <p>
    Interference: When multiple signals overlap, they superpose which can distort the signal, or completely eliminate it (destructive interference). 
  </p>
  <p>
    Jamming: The deliberate transmission of RF noise at the same frequency of that being used to communicate with the drone. This overwhelms the original signal due to the waves superposing and the drone can no longer make out the commands or messages. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Signal spoofing: This is where fake signals that look like the real ones are sent to the drone, for example, fake GPS locations or fake attack commands that are meant to disrupt tactics.

    <h2>Directed Energy Weapons</h2>
    <p>
      Directed energy weapons (DEWs) are ones that damage their target using a source of highly concentrated energy, rather than any solid projectiles. The main types include Lasers, microwaves and particle beams. Lasers are the most widely used DEW and were invented in 1960 and first used for combat purposes in the Vietnam and Falklands wars during the 1970s and 1980s [18][19]. They were used for targeting and guiding bombs. Microwave DEWs began being used in the Iraq War in the early 2000s as electronic weapons, disabling systems [20]. They have since been used in counter-drone operations in the 2020s – the UK MoD used them between 2024 and 2025 for this purpose [21].

    <h3>Lasers (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation)</h3>
    <p>
      Laser weapons concentrate electromagnetic energy into a narrow beam that transfers
      thermal energy to a target. Their effectiveness depends on power density,
      wavelength, and atmospheric absorption.
    </p>

    <div class="equation">
      Power density = P / (πr²)
    </div>

    <h3>High-Power Microwave DEWs</h3>
    <p>
      High-power microwave weapons emit intense electromagnetic pulses that disrupt or
      damage electronic systems. They operate through electromagnetic induction and
      energy transfer to circuits.

    <h2>Cyber Warfare</h2>
    <p>
      Cyber warfare involves attacking or defending digital infrastructure through
      network intrusion, encryption breaking, and information disruption. It relies on
      principles of computer science, signal transmission, and data security.
