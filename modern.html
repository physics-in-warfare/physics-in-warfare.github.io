    <h2>Drone Warfare</h2>
    <p>
      Pilotless vehicles were initially developed in the UK in the First World War and development continued         throughout the interwar period. They began to be used on a larger scale during the Vietnam War by the US as Reconnaissance UAVs (Unmanned Ariel Vehicles), but they were also used as combat decoys, for finding targets to launch missiles, and for dropping leaflets and posters for psychological propaganda [1]. Drones were used at an even greater scale in Afghanistan in the 2000s where they moved from taking a more surveillance focussed role, to an active combat role, as this was the era of the first known lethal drone strike [2]. Today, drones have been used in the Russia-Ukraine war, both as direct attacks on Ukrainian cities and as threatening surveillance in other countries in Europe including Germany and Norway, displaying how useful they are [3]. </p>

    <h3>The Aerodynamics of Drones</h3>
       
Drone flight (and any aircraft flight) involves four forces: 
<br>

Lift: The upward force that counteracts weight and allows the drone to remain in the air. Lift arises due to the pressure difference between the top and the bottom of the wing of the aircraft and the downward deflection of air, which produces an upward force equal and opposite to it. The left equation is given by
<br>
  $$
L = \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 C_L S
$$
  <br>
  where $\rho$ is the air density, $v$ is the air speed, $C_L$ is the lift coefficient, and $S$ is the wing area.
[5] 
This links to warfare as military drones often require efficient lift to save energy to carry out long surveillances. As well as this, high altitude drones need larger wings due to lower air density to stay airborne. 

 <br>

Weight: Downward force exerted by Earth's gravitational field. This means drones with more mass (mass is often increased by equipment such as weapons, cameras or sensors) need greater lift, which uses more energy and requires better propellers or more powerful motors.
<br> 
[6] 
<br> 
Military drones are often also made using lightweight materials, for example: 
<br> 
 Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) - This is used for wings, airframes, propeller arms. It has a high strength to weight ratio and low density leading to an overall lower weight. It also has a high stiffness which reduces the amount of potential aerodynamic deformation while in flight. 
<br> 
 Fiberglass Composites – These are used for fuselages (the main body of drone, including electronics and flight systems) and radar covers. It is a lightweight material. It also allows EM radar waves to go straight through with little absorption or reflection so the drone is not easy to detect. 
<br> 
Titanium alloys – These are used to house the engine and other particularly important parts as it has very high strength and so is unlikely to deform. It is also heat resistant so it works well at protecting specific parts of the drone. 
<br> 
 

Thrust: The upward force produced by the propulsion system of the drone. The propellers push the air backwards and this change in momentum creates thrust in the forward direction. 
<br> 
[7] 
<br> 
Thrust in drones is produced by electric motors (which produce an electromagnetic torque) and batteries or internal combustion engines. However it is also good to consider the noise level of each type of motor as this is key for drone detection. This is important in a war setting because thrust determines how fast a drone can accelerate and therefore how fast it can escape an attack. 
<br> 
 

Drag: The force opposing motion through a fluid (air, in the case of drones). 
<br> 
[8] 
<br> 
The types of drag include parasitic drag (from the body, wings, weapons etc of the drone), induced drag (caused by generating lift), and skin friction (due to the viscosity of the air). The reduction of drag is important in drones because it increases two-fold with speed and external weaponry can significantly increase it. Drag can be decreased by using streamlined designs, increasing the efficiency and flight time.

    <h3>Control and Navigation</h3>
    <p>
      Drones use control systems involving gyroscopes, accelerometers, and feedback loops
      to maintain stability and direction. GPS positioning and onboard computers enable
      autonomous navigation and precise manoeuvring.
    </p>

    <h3>Sensors and Target Detection</h3>
    <p>
      Modern drones use infrared cameras, radar, and optical sensors to detect and track
      targets. Signal processing and electromagnetic wave behaviour determine detection
      range and accuracy.

    <h2>Directed Energy Weapons</h2>

    <h3>Lasers (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation)</h3>
    <p>
      Laser weapons concentrate electromagnetic energy into a narrow beam that transfers
      thermal energy to a target. Their effectiveness depends on power density,
      wavelength, and atmospheric absorption.
    </p>

    <div class="equation">
      Power density = P / (πr²)
    </div>

    <h3>High-Power Microwave DEWs</h3>
    <p>
      High-power microwave weapons emit intense electromagnetic pulses that disrupt or
      damage electronic systems. They operate through electromagnetic induction and
      energy transfer to circuits.

    <h2>Cyber Warfare</h2>
    <p>
      Cyber warfare involves attacking or defending digital infrastructure through
      network intrusion, encryption breaking, and information disruption. It relies on
      principles of computer science, signal transmission, and data security.
