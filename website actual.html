<h1>The Physics of Nuclear Weapons</h1>

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<div class="content-block">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="flex-row">
<div class="flex-text">
<p>
One of the greatest impacts on warfare in history was the development of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons played a defining factor in ending WW2 and were a major influence during the cold war. Their shear level of destruction these weapons can cause has created a sense of fear within the public, which has been strengthened from their depiction in media. While nuclear weapons have a very macroscopic imagery, the microscopic physics behind them was because of decades of research and discovery from many different scientists. Here we will breakdown what led to the development of nuclear weapons and explore the physics behind the different types of nuclear weapons there are and their impact on warfare.

Before the creation of nuclear weapons, the most powerful conventional weapon was the British Gland Slam bomb also known as the earthquake bomb. It weighed 10 tonnes as would penetrate the ground before exploding in order to damage strong reinforced structures particularly to target the German U-boat pens [2]. However even the greatest conventional bomb was nothing when it came to the level of destruction that arose from the atomic bombs later in the war, with the bomb used on Hiroshima being roughly 2,000 times more powerful than the Grand Slam.

<!-- HISTORY -->
<div class="content-block">
<h2>History of Nuclear Physics</h2>
<p>
The first stride in nuclear physics was make by Henri Becquerel in 1896 who identified that uranium salts marked photographic paper marking the discovery of natural radioactivity [4]. Building off this work Marie and Pierre Curie formally came up with the term radioactivity and Marie discovered the elements Polonium and Radium [5]; the idea that radioactivity is an innate property of atoms was also established. One of the next significant leaps in nuclear physics was in 1909 where Ernest Rutherford prompted the notion that atoms contain a nucleus which was a charged concentrated centre of mass [6]. Eventually this lead to Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938 discovering nuclear fission from their bombardment of uranium with neutrons [7].
</p>
</div>

<!-- NUCLEAR PHYSICS -->
<div class="content-block">
<h2>Nuclear Physics</h2>
<p>Here covers the basics of fission, fusion, binding energy and critical mass.</p>

<h3>What is fission?</h3>
<p>Fission is what powers atomic bombs and nuclear powerplants.</p>
<p>
Process by which a nucleus is bombarded with a neutron which causes the nucleus to become unstable resulting in it splitting into two smaller nuclei. From this a large amount of energy is released additionally each fission reaction emits other neutrons which can be absorbed by other atoms creating a chain reaction.
</p>

<div class="equation">
<sup>235</sup>U + <sup>1</sup>n → <sup>141</sup>Ba + <sup>92</sup>Kr + 3 <sup>1</sup>n
</div>

<ul>
<li>Uranium-235 absorbs a neutron</li>
<li>The uranium-235 atom is split into barium-141 and krypton-92 atoms</li>
<li>Three neutrons are emitted</li>
</ul>
<p>[8]</p>

<h3>What is fusion?</h3>
<p>
Fusion is the process by which stars are powered like our Sun and is the process behind thermonuclear (hydrogen) bombs.
</p>
<p>
Fusion is when two nuclei fuse together forming a heavier nucleus and releases energy in the process, releasing energy in the process.
</p>

<div class="equation">
<sup>2</sup>H + <sup>3</sup>H → <sup>4</sup>He + <sup>1</sup>n
</div>

<ul>
<li>Deuterium (hydrogen-2) and tritium (hydrogen-3) are fused together</li>
<li>Helium-4 is produced</li>
<li>A neutron is emitted</li>
</ul>
<p>[9]</p>

<h3>Binding Energy</h3>

<p>
Binding energy (Eb) - energy that is released when the nucleus is formed from all the protons and neutrons coming together. So is also the energy required to separate a nucleus into individual protons and neutrons [10].
</p>

<p>
When binding energy increases energy is released. In both fission and fusion reactions there is a positive change in binding energy so energy is released.
</p>

<p>
This energy is as a result of conversion of a small amount of mass into energy. Mass and energy are connected together the Alberts Einsteins famous mass-energy equivalence equation.
</p>

<div class="equation">
E = mc<sup>2</sup>
</div>

<p>
The bomb dropped on Hiroshima released the equivalent energy from 15,000 tonnes of TNT (tTNT) exploding [11]. This amount of energy was from approximate 0.7 g of mass being converted into energy.
</p>

<h3>Why is fusion more powerful than fission?</h3>

<p>
Fusion appears to more powerful than fission as hydrogen bombs have a much greater yield than atomic bombs. However the fission of one atom of uranium-235 with release more energy than the fusion of deuterium and tritium. The reason hydrogen bombs are more powerful is because while one fission reaction releases more energy, uranium-235 is a far more heavy atom than the two hydrogen isotopes. Therefore the energy released per 1 kg of fuel is far greater for fusion than fission.
</p>

<p>
The change in binding energy and thus the energy released can be determined by calculating the difference in total binding energy of the reactants and products.
</p>

<div class="equation">
energy released = binding energy of products − binding energy of reactants
</div>

<div class="equation">
ΔE<sub>b</sub> = E<sub>b(products)</sub> − E<sub>b(reactants)</sub>
</div>

<p>
Using the values of binding energy in the tables below, the value for energy released can be calculated for the fission and fusion reaction examples given previously.
</p>

<div class="table-image">
<img src="table.png">
<div class="caption">[12]</div>
</div>

<p>
The calculations show that the fission of uranium-235 releases 4.44 multiplied by ten to the power of 26 MeV of energy per 1 kg of fuel. Whereas the fusion of deuterium and tritium releases 2.12 multiplied by ten to the power of 27 MeV of energy per 1 kg of fuel. So 1 Kg of fusion fuel will produce roughly over four times as much energy as that of the same mass of fission fuel.
</p>

<h3>Critical Mass</h3>

<p><strong>What is critical mass?</strong></p>
<p>
critical mass is defined as the minimum amount of a fissionable material required to create a self-sustaining fission reaction. For the bomb to detonate critical mass must be reach (ideally supercritical mass which will release more energy).
</p>

<ul>
<li>Criticality is when more neutrons are being produced than lost.</li>
<li>Sub-critical is when each fission reaction propagates to cause less than one other fission reaction.</li>
<li>Super critical is when each fission reaction propagates to cause more than one other fission reaction.</li>
</ul>

<div class="equation">
k<sub>eff</sub> = (number of neutrons being produced) / (number of neutrons being lost)
</div>

<ul>
<li>If Keff &lt; 1 then it is sub-critical</li>
<li>If Keff = 1 then it is critical</li>
<li>If Keff &gt; 1 then it is super-critical</li>
</ul>

<p>[13]</p>

<h4>Factors affecting critical mass</h4>

<ul>
<li>density – increasing density of the fission fuel increases the probability of a neutron being absorbed by a nucleus that will cause a fission reaction.</li>
<li>shape – the shape of the core can be designed to reduce the amount of neutrons being lost through the surface area. The sphere is the most efficient shape for the core and is used in the atomic bombs. This is because the sphere for a given volume has the smallest surface area, since volume increases with the cube of radius whereas surface area increases with the square of radius. By minimising the surface area less neutrons are lost so neutrons are more likely to be absorbed by a fissionable nucleus.</li>
<li>enrichment/purity – using the example of uranium, U-235 is the isotope that is the fissionable fuel in the atomic bombs. However U-235 is only 0.7% abundant with U-239 being over 99% abundant. So through enrichment the percentage of U-235 can be increased, this increases the probability of a neutron being absorbed by a U-235 nucleus as those nuclei are more concentrated. Uranium can be enriched to reach over 90% U-235, which is called weapons grade [14].</li>
</ul>

<p>
So criticality can be reached by increasing the mass of fissionable material to the point of critical mass. Likewise for a given mass of fissionable material conditions can be applied to reduce the critical mass until it reaches the mass of the given fissionable material. The two atomic bombs dropped on Japan in WW2 used these two different methods to reach criticality.

<h3>Chain reaction theorised</h3>

<p>
Although Hahn and Strassmann initially discovered nuclear fission, they did not fully understand how to interpret their results. It was not until 1939 when Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch who identified that in each fission reaction energy was released by mass was being converted to energy as a result of the uranium-235 nucleus being split into two smaller nuclei. They also recognised that each fission reaction releases more neutrons than are absorbed, which could in turn induce further fission reactions [15]. From this basis that fission reactions produce a high amount of energy and have the ability to self-sustain. So the chain reaction was proven to be possible, this showed the potential for nuclear fission to be weaponised in the form of a bomb. This lead to much talk amongst the scientific community about the potential for fission reaction, but there was also a lot of concern about the risks of such power. As a result most notably Leo Szilard, who had theorised the chain reaction in 1933, wrote a letter and signed by Albert Einstein, to the President of the United States, Roosevelt. This letter warned the US that Nazi Germany may start to create a nuclear weapon and urged the US to enter the arms race to develop it first. From this the Manhattan Project was born.

</div>

<!-- MANHATTAN PROJECT -->
<div class="content-block">
<h2>The Manhattan Project</h2>



<p>
After Roosevelt received the Szilard-Einstein letter, he established the Advisory Committee on Uranium [17]. However it was not until 1941 when the US entered the war that the US started to make nuclear weapons research a key focus. In 1942 the Manhattan Project was established, it was led by General Groves, who was the military director as well as Robert Oppenheimer, who was the scientific director. The project received $2.2B in funding, which is worth roughly $28B in today's money. As well as that they had huge amounts of personal, with over 130,000 people working on the project across many sites including Chicago (Fermi's reactor), Tennessee (uranium enrichment), Washington (plutonium production) and most notably Los Alamos in New Mexico (bomb development) [18].
</p>

<p>
The Manhattan Project is one of the first example of large scale government funded projects and it shows the collaboration between scientists and the military/government produces the environment where the key scientific minds are working together with large amounts of resources, where major advancement are possible to be made. The first major breakthrough for the Manhattan project was in 1942 when Enrico Fermi created the first controlled nuclear fission chain reaction at the University of Chicago [19]. This moment proved that a chain reaction was possible and that it had the potential to be used as a bomb. The experiment was only possible as a result of funding the US military invested for them to purchase graphite. Graphite was needed for this nuclear reactor as it acted as the moderator, which slows down fast moving neutrons so that they have a higher probability of being absorbed by a uranium-235 nucleus, allowing a Keff value of 1 to be achieved more easily. This is what distinguished the US nuclear program from that of the Nazis, as they were using heavy water as a moderator. While heavy water is a better moderator there was many production issues Germany faced with producing it, which delayed their advancement of a nuclear bomb, compared with the much more easily producible graphite the US adopted. The reason that the Nazis did not identify graphite as a suitable moderator is because graphite naturally contains boron impurities, boron is what is used as control rods in nuclear reactors as it is a good neutron absorber. As a result for not accounting for this graphite appeared to be a poor moderator as the boron impurities were absorbing neutrons which prevented the Keff from reaching the value of 1. Whereas the US got around this by purifying graphite, which was much easier than producing heavy water.
</p>

<p>
Eventually after all the collaboration and scientific breakthroughs in 1945 on the 16th of July the Manhattan project tested for the first time an atomic bomb, this was named the Trinity Test. They tested a plutonium core implosion bomb called The Gadget and it successfully demonstrated the functionality of nuclear weapons and there destructive capabilities. This was a pivotal moment in history, the Pandora's Box of nuclear weapons was opened. Robert Oppenheimer later said in that moment he thought of the line "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." from the Bhagavad Gita [20].
</p>

<p>
The Manhattan Project in addition to The Gadget make two other atomic bombs, the Little Boy (uranium bomb), which was dropped on Hiroshima and the Fat Man (plutonium bomb) which was dropped on Nagasaki. Both of these bombs were atomic and based on the fission of the explosive fuel, though used different initiating systems due to the different fuels used.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Little Boy – Uranium bomb</h3>

<div class="flex-row">

  <div class="flex-text">
    <p>
    This bomb implemented a gun system to initiate the fission reaction, though the gun method only works with a uranium-235 fuelled atomic bomb. To reach criticality, two masses, which are both sub-critical are combined together by effectively shooting one mass into the other [21]. When these to combine the total mass reaches critical mass and criticality is achieved so that a chain reaction is able to occur. The final arrangement of the two masses is in a spherical shape as this is the most efficient shape to have a lower critical mass. Criticality is reached as with a larger volume less neutron are lost, this is because neutrons are lost through the surface area of the fissionable material. But when the fissionable material is arranged in a spherical shape volume increases with the cube of radius whereas surface area increases with the square of radius, so more neutron will be absorbed rather than lost when volume increases, resulting in a keff of over 1. Once the final arrangement has occurred the chain reaction needs to be initiated by the release of neutrons to be absorbed by uranium 235 to create the initial fission reactions. This is done by a device called an Urchin, which contains polonium and beryllium in separate sections, the Urchin would be smashed when the two masses of uranium were shot together resulting in the mixing the two elements together. The reaction from the polonium and beryllium releases neutrons which can be absorbed by uranium-235 nuclei causing them to fission [22]. Once this happens the uncontrolled fission reaction would occur and the bomb would explode.

  </div>

  <div class="flex-text">
    <p>
    The gun initiator does not work for plutonium as plutonium has a much higher rate of spontaneous fission than uranium. This means that it naturally releases more neutrons than uranium over a given time, as a result while the two masses of fissionable material are being combined neutrons are being released, which can cause the chain reaction to occur before the two masses have been fully combined. As a result the bomb will explode without all of plutonium undergoing fission, so the explosion yield is much lower. So the gun initiator is too slow for plutonium as we want the chain reaction to commence after the core has been full assembled not just before. This is not an issue as an insignificant number of neutrons will be released from the uranium in the time the gun system takes to fully combine the two masses [25].
    </p>

    <p>
    Due to plutonium's high rate of spontaneous fission, maximum supercriticality needs to be reached faster so that the chain reaction does not occur too early resulting in a lower explosive yield. To overcome this, criticality can also be reached by increasing the density of the fissionable material rather than increasing the total mass. Increasing density increases that value of Keff as any neutrons produced are more likely to collide with another plutonium atom if the plutonium is packed closer together. This increase in density is achieved by from a conventional explosion which is focus around the plutonium core, this compresses the core thus increasing the density, this is called the implosion method [26]. Because this process is much faster than the gun initiator, the time to go from critical to the maximum supercritical stage is much smaller, reducing the chance of the naturally produced neutrons initiating the chain reaction. The Fat Man bomb also used a Urchin to release neutron to initiate the fission reactions, the Urchin is broken by the same explosion that compresses the core.
    </p>
  </div>

</div>

<h3>Urchin reaction</h3>

<p>
Polonium naturally releases alpha particles (α) which are made up of two proton and two neutron, equivalently a helium nucleus. When these alpha particles collide with a beryllium nucleus they form carbon nuclei and most importantly neutrons, which are needed to initiate the fission reactions. The reaction of beryllium with an alpha particle is shown below.

<h4>Why were two bombs dropped?</h4>

<div class="flex-row">

  <div class="flex-text">
    <p>
    The first bomb was to demonstrate the power of the bomb and the second was to show that the US could continue to drop them. The two bombings were three days apart and under a week after the second bombing Japan surrendered. While the Manhattan Project only produced three atomic bombs including the one used for the Trinity Test they still had more plutonium and uranium that could have been used to manufacture further bombs if it were necessary.

<!-- IMPACT ON WARFARE -->
<div class="content-block">
  <h2>Impact on warfare</h2>

  <p>
  Nuclear weapons had a fundamental impact on warfare as all of a sudden in an instant an entire city could be destroyed as seen in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While the tactical impact is massive with being able completely halt war production capabilities of an area, there is also a significant phycological impact and the image of a mushroom cloud has become a symbol of fear. This phycological side to nuclear weapons is what distinguishes them from conventional weapons as in WW2 the US conducted firebombing raids on Tokyo which killed more people and created more destruction [34], yet it was the idea that one bomb could cause such devastation that pushed the Japanese to surrender. The word ‘nuclear’ has almost become a weapon itself and creates such fear to this day.
  </p>

  <p>
  After the initial discovery of fission an arms race started with many of the major nations fighting in WW2 having nuclear programs including USA, Germany, Russia and Japan. Although the US put the most funding behind it and German leaders did not grasp the significance of nuclear power and thought of it as a long term project, while the US realised they could develop the bomb in a matter of years. Another factor that assisted in the US winning the arms race was than many of the key scientists that were involved in the Manhattan Project or surrounding research fled to the US to escape Nazi controlled Europe, notable names include Einstein, Szilard, Fermi and Teller [35].  As a result the US was the first to create the atomic bomb and after the two bombings on Japan, seeing the power of atomic weapons Russia accelerated its nuclear program and with the help of information gathered by spies they developed theirs in 1949, removing the US’s key military advantage.
  </p>

  <p>
  It can be argued that nuclear weapons act as a deterrent and help prevent potential conflicts from occurring. As despite the thousands of nuclear weapons that have been produced and that are currently held, the only times they have been used in an act of war have been the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So the only time they have been deployed is when just one country had them, this power imbalance is what lowers the threshold for deploying nuclear weapons as there is no risk of retaliation. Would the US have dropped the two atomic bombs on Japan if they knew Japan also had atomic weapons? This threat of mutual destruction is the deterrent that prevents countries using nuclear weapons on each other to this day, as if you bomb them they will bomb you back to put it simply. With the development of nuclear submarines, even if an entire nation is destroyed, they can still strike back, so the threat of retaliation can never effectively be removed, thus maintaining the deterrent.
  </p>

</div>


<!-- POST WW2 DEVELOPMENT -->
<div class="content-block">

<h2>Post ww2 development</h2>

<h3>Hydrogen bomb also fusion and thermonuclear bomb</h3>

<p>
The hydrogen bomb which uses nuclear fusion was developed after WW2. Edward Teller was a key scientist in the development of this bomb, he was part of the Manhattan project, yet his proposal of such a weapon was seen as a distraction to the development of the atomic bomb. It was not until after the end of the war that the backing of this weapon was given as the US military saw its potential. Although Oppenheimer fiercely lobbied against the development of the hydrogen bomb after seeing the impact of the atomic bombs on Japan [31]. This was the start in time where the government had control over scientific development not the scientists themselves, the Collingridge dilemma highlights how control of a discovery is lost as it is developed further. In 1952 the US developed the first hydrogen bomb called the Ivy Mike.
</p>

<p>
The challenges of construction a bomb that harnesses fusion is that the conditions required for such fusion reactions to occur are so extreme. It take pressures and temperature of within the Sun for fusion. The solution to this was to use a small nuclear fission explosion to create the conditions for fusion. For this method the same setup at in Fat Man is used, where an implosion initiator is used on a plutonium or uranium core. This creates a fission chain reaction which releases gamma rays and x-rays which turns the polystyrene filled cavity into plasma. This plasma compresses the cylindrically shaped fusion fuel to the point where it can undergo fusion. The fusion fuel is usually lithium deuteride as the fuel as the lithium can absorb a neutron from the fission reaction to produce tritium (see equation below) which can fuse with the deuterium from the fuel. Often the hydrogen bomb is cased in uranium to help deflect neutrons produced from the nuclear reaction back to the fuel to help the chain reaction, but this uranium will also fission resulting in a greater explosive yield [32].

<!-- COLD WAR AND NUCLEAR TRIAD -->
<div class="content-block">
  <h2>Nuclear weapons in the Cold War and the nuclear triad</h2>

  <p>
  Nuclear weapons played a major role in the cold war with the US and the soviet union in an arms race to have the most powerful bomb. The USSR creates the Tsar-Bomb which created a 50 megatons of TNT [36] explosion equivalent to roughly over 3 thousand Little Boy bombs, however this was only a test bomb and was never developed to the point of deployability.
  </p>

  Although the basic technology of nuclear weapons has not changed significantly in recent years, developments in the method of deployment has been made. Initially nuclear bombs had to be dropped by aircraft but with the introduction of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and stealth bombers such as the American B-2 [37], detection and defensive measures of strikes became more challenging thus increasing the threat. The ability to deploy nuclear weapons from land, sea and air is called the nuclear triad.This development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) changed the threat of nuclear weapons as before nuclear weapons would have to be dropped by aircraft which gave countries abilities to shoot down the aircraft before a strike. However with ICBMs a strike could effectively be conducted from any part of the world and reach any country.

  <p>
  The Cuban Missile Crisis displays the height of the nuclear threat during the cold war, the Soviet Union moved nuclear capable ballistic missiles into Cuba which could reach main land US. Missiles being positioned so close meant he reaction time was very limited for the US if there was a strike, leaving them extremely vulnerable. This highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons as conflicts between nuclear weapon holding countries can quickly rise in tension and any escalation can have extremely serious consequences. After this crisis was resolved a hotline was established between Washington DC and Moscow in order to prevent any potential nuclear exchange [39].

  <p>
  The ability for nuclear weapons to be deployed via submarines holding submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) sits as another major shift in nuclear weaponry and can be argued that it is beneficial for peace. As if a country is completely destroyed by nuclear strikes but have nuclear capable submarines they can still strike back. So the ability of retaliation cannot be removed through a pre-emptive strike, which reinforces the idea of mutual destruction, which is a major factor preventing the use of nuclear weapons.

<!-- NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION AND CURRENT STATES -->
<div class="content-block">
  <h2>Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and current nuclear states</h2>

  <p>
  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty came into effect in 1970. Where by countries without nuclear weapons agreed to not develop them and countries with them, which at the time was (The United State, Russia, China, France and The UK) agreed not to assist any other countries with development of such weapons [40]. Although now four more nation currently have nuclear weapons, additionally South Africa build 6 atomic bombs but decommissioned them all by 1991. Ukraine also inherited nuclear weapons after the collapse of the Soviet Union but relinquished them to Russia by 1996.

<!-- FUTURE IMPACT -->
<div class="content-block">
  <h2>Future impact</h2>

  <p>
  The threat on nuclear weapons is likely never going to cease to exist as the pandora box has been opened and there will always be that risk. Although perhaps a new development in Physics may be made that results in an even more powerful weapon than the nuclear bomb making them redundant. However the current destruction level of nuclear weapons raises the question about the necessity to make a 'bigger bomb'. Unless there are new unconventional weapons that are developed which are not about creating the biggest explosion or major advancement in air defence that make nuclear weapons redundant, these weapons are likely going to have a lasting impact on warfare. While there will be a continued diplomatic push to bring an end to nuclear weapons with strides may be taken to reduce missile arsenals, it is most probable that the world will never be free from any kind of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are just another example of arms race in the history of warfare, as whoever has the most advanced weaponry has an advantage in war. However nuclear weapon races can be argued to actually prevent wars whereas conventional weapon races are aimed to win wars.
